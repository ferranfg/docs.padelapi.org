Professional padel generates detailed statistics for every match. The Padel API organizes this data at three levels: **match**, **player**, and **pair**. Each level answers different questions.

## Match statistics

The most granular level. Every match with available data includes stats for both teams, broken down by set.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://padelapi.org/api/matches/{match_id}/stats' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

A match stats response includes overall totals plus per-set breakdowns:

```json
{
  "id": 1216,
  "match": {
    "total_points_won": { "team_1": "50%", "team_2": "50%" },
    "break_points_converted": { "team_1": "33%", "team_2": "22%" },
    "longest_streak": { "team_1": "5", "team_2": "7" },
    "won_on_1st_serve": { "team_1": "67%", "team_2": "65%" },
    "won_on_2nd_serve": { "team_1": "54%", "team_2": "55%" },
    "total_won_on_serve": { "team_1": "66%", "team_2": "64%" },
    "total_won_on_return": { "team_1": "36%", "team_2": "34%" },
    "service_games": { "team_1": "15", "team_2": "15" },
    "return_games": { "team_1": "15", "team_2": "15" }
  },
  "set_1": { ... },
  "set_2": { ... },
  "set_3": { ... }
}
```

### Available metrics per set

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `total_points_won` | Percentage of total points won |
| `break_points_converted` | Break point conversion rate |
| `longest_streak` | Longest consecutive points won |
| `aces` | Number of aces |
| `double_faults` | Number of double faults |
| `won_on_1st_serve` | Win % on first serve |
| `won_on_2nd_serve` | Win % on second serve |
| `total_won_on_serve` | Overall serve win % |
| `won_on_1st_return` | Win % returning first serve |
| `won_on_2nd_return` | Win % returning second serve |
| `total_won_on_return` | Overall return win % |
| `service_games` | Number of service games played |
| `return_games` | Number of return games played |

<Tip>
  Set-by-set data lets you track momentum shifts. A team winning 77% on serve in set 3 after 59% in set 1 tells a story that the match total alone doesn't.
</Tip>

## Player statistics

Career-level aggregates for any player. Useful for comparing trajectories, building rankings models, or analyzing form over specific periods.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://padelapi.org/api/players/{player_id}/stats' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

```json
{
  "id": 65,
  "matches_played": 160,
  "matches_won": 147,
  "win_percentage": 91.88,
  "sets_won": 303,
  "sets_lost": 49,
  "avg_sets_per_match": 2.2,
  "games_won": 2062,
  "games_lost": 1186,
  "avg_games_per_match": 20.3,
  "titles": 23,
  "finals": 30,
  "semifinals": 33,
  "best_round": 1
}
```

### Filtering by date range

Player stats accept `after_date` and `before_date` parameters to calculate stats over a specific period. This is useful for season-by-season comparisons or tracking form over time.

```bash
# Stats for the 2025 season only
curl -X GET \
  'https://padelapi.org/api/players/65/stats?after_date=2025-01-01&before_date=2025-12-31' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

### Filtering by round

Use the `round` parameter to isolate performance at specific tournament stages.

```bash
# Stats in finals only
curl -X GET \
  'https://padelapi.org/api/players/65/stats?round=1' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

| Round value | Stage |
|-------------|-------|
| `1` | Final |
| `2` | Semifinal |
| `4` | Quarterfinal |
| `8` | Round of 16 |
| `16` | Round of 32 |
| `32` | Round of 64 |

<Tip>
  Comparing a player's win percentage in early rounds vs finals reveals how they perform under pressure. Some players dominate early rounds but underperform in decisive matches, and vice versa.
</Tip>

## Pair statistics

Padel is a doubles sport, and individual numbers only tell part of the story. Pair stats measure how two specific players perform **together**.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://padelapi.org/api/pairs/{player_1_id}-{player_2_id}/stats' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

```json
{
  "id": "65-66",
  "matches_played": 302,
  "matches_won": 276,
  "win_percentage": 91.39,
  "sets_won": 567,
  "sets_lost": 101,
  "avg_sets_per_match": 2.21,
  "games_won": 3892,
  "games_lost": 2341,
  "avg_games_per_match": 20.64,
  "titles": 43,
  "finals": 57,
  "semifinals": 62,
  "best_round": 1
}
```

Pair stats also support `after_date`, `before_date`, and `round` filters, just like player stats.

### What pair stats reveal

The gap between a player's individual stats and their pair stats exposes partner chemistry. A player with an 80% win rate overall but 90% with a specific partner suggests that pairing is greater than the sum of its parts.

Compare pairs across:
- **Win percentage** to find the most dominant duos
- **Titles vs finals** to measure conversion rate in decisive matches
- **Average games per match** as a proxy for match difficulty (lower = more dominant wins)

## Common use cases

### Building a player comparison dashboard

Combine player stats with date filters to create season-by-season comparisons:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

API_TOKEN = "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}"}
BASE_URL = "https://padelapi.org/api"

player_id = 65
seasons = [
    ("2023-01-01", "2023-12-31"),
    ("2024-01-01", "2024-12-31"),
    ("2025-01-01", "2025-12-31"),
]

for start, end in seasons:
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/players/{player_id}/stats",
        headers=HEADERS,
        params={"after_date": start, "before_date": end}
    )
    stats = response.json()
    print(f"{start[:4]}: {stats['matches_won']}/{stats['matches_played']} "
          f"({stats['win_percentage']}%) - {stats['titles']} titles")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const API_TOKEN = "YOUR_API_TOKEN";
const BASE_URL = "https://padelapi.org/api";
const headers = { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_TOKEN}` };

const playerId = 65;
const seasons = [
  ["2023-01-01", "2023-12-31"],
  ["2024-01-01", "2024-12-31"],
  ["2025-01-01", "2025-12-31"],
];

for (const [start, end] of seasons) {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({ after_date: start, before_date: end });
  const response = await fetch(
    `${BASE_URL}/players/${playerId}/stats?${params}`,
    { headers }
  );
  const stats = await response.json();
  console.log(`${start.slice(0, 4)}: ${stats.matches_won}/${stats.matches_played} ` +
    `(${stats.win_percentage}%) - ${stats.titles} titles`);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Analyzing serve dominance in a match

Extract serve and return metrics to understand match dynamics:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/matches/1216/stats",
    headers=HEADERS
)
stats = response.json()

for set_key in ["set_1", "set_2", "set_3"]:
    if set_key in stats:
        s = stats[set_key]
        print(f"{set_key}: Team 1 serve {s['total_won_on_serve']['team_1']} "
              f"| Team 2 serve {s['total_won_on_serve']['team_2']}")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  `${BASE_URL}/matches/1216/stats`,
  { headers }
);
const stats = await response.json();

for (const setKey of ["set_1", "set_2", "set_3"]) {
  if (stats[setKey]) {
    const s = stats[setKey];
    console.log(`${setKey}: Team 1 serve ${s.total_won_on_serve.team_1} ` +
      `| Team 2 serve ${s.total_won_on_serve.team_2}`);
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not all matches have stats">
    Match statistics depend on official data availability. Major and P1 tournaments typically have full stats coverage, while lower-level tournaments may not. Check the response before assuming data exists.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Player IDs can change">
    When two player records are merged, the API returns a `302` redirect to the canonical player. Handle redirects in your HTTP client to avoid broken references.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Padel Analyst for exploration">
    Before writing code, you can explore stats interactively using [Padel Analyst](/padel-analyst/index). Ask questions like *"What's Coello's win percentage in finals?"* or *"Show me match stats for the latest Major final"* to find what you need.
  </Accordion>
