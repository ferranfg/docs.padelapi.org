## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Padel API account ([sign up here](https://padelapi.org/register))
- An API token from your [API Tokens](https://padelapi.org/user/api-tokens) page

## Step 1: Get Your API Token

1. Log in to your [Padel API account](https://padelapi.org/login)
2. Navigate to [API Tokens](https://padelapi.org/user/api-tokens)
3. Click **Create Token** and give it a descriptive name
4. Copy your token and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again

<Warning>
  Keep your API token secret. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Make Your First Request

Let's fetch the list of available seasons. This is a simple endpoint that returns all padel seasons available in the API.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET \
  'https://padelapi.org/api/seasons' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://padelapi.org/api/seasons', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
  }
});

const seasons = await response.json();
console.log(seasons);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://padelapi.org/api/seasons',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'}
)

seasons = response.json()
print(seasons)
```

```php PHP
$ch = curl_init();

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://padelapi.org/api/seasons');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
]);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$seasons = json_decode($response, true);

print_r($seasons);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 3: Explore the Response

A successful response returns a JSON array with season data:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 5,
      "self": "/api/seasons/5",
      "name": "Premier Padel 2026",
      "tournaments_count": 28,
      "status": "upcoming",
      "start_date": "2026-02-09",
      "end_date": "2026-12-13",
      "year": 2026,
      "connections": {
        "tournaments": "/api/seasons/5/tournaments"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "self": "/api/seasons/3",
      "name": "Padel FIP 2025",
      "tournaments_count": 40,
      "status": "finished",
      "start_date": "2025-02-08",
      "end_date": "2025-12-14",
      "year": 2025,
      "connections": {
        "tournaments": "/api/seasons/3/tournaments"
      }
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "first": "https://padelapi.org/api/seasons?page=1",
    "last": "https://padelapi.org/api/seasons?page=1",
    "prev": null,
    "next": null
  },
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "last_page": 1,
    "per_page": 15,
    "total": 6
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Fetch Player Rankings

Now let's try something more interesting. Fetching the current player rankings:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://padelapi.org/api/players?category=men&sort_by=ranking&order_by=asc' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

You can filter players by category (`men` or `women`) and paginate results using the `page` and `per_page` parameters.
