<Info>
  **Padel Fan Index** is our analytics product for brands, sponsors, and players in professional padel. It combines engagement data from [Fantasy Padel Tour](https://fantasypadeltour.com) with performance data from Padel API to quantify the real visibility of players among active padel fans.
</Info>

## Why It's Different

Traditional sponsorship metrics rely on passive impressions: social media followers, TV viewership estimates, or event attendance. Padel Fan Index measures something far more valuable: **active fan decisions**.

Every data point in a Padel Fan Index report represents a deliberate action by a fan: selecting a player for their fantasy team, choosing them as a starter, or investing their limited budget on that player over others. These are signals of genuine preference that passive metrics cannot capture.

## What's in a Report

Each Padel Fan Index report provides a comprehensive analysis of a player's brand value:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fan Reach & Engagement" icon="users">
    How many unique fans actively chose this player, and how often. Measured as real decisions across every tournament of the season.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Starter Trust Rate" icon="star">
    When fans select a player, do they trust them enough to start them? A high starter rate signals strong fan confidence.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ownership Growth" icon="chart-line">
    How the player's market share evolved across the season, normalized against the growing user base to ensure fair comparisons.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Demand Resilience" icon="shield">
    Does fan demand hold up when the player's price increases? A resilience index above 1.0 means demand grew faster than price, a sign of organic, genuine interest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Popularity Index & Gap" icon="ranking-star">
    How popular is the player relative to their ranking? A positive gap means the player attracts more fans than their competitive level would predict, valuable for sponsors seeking underpriced visibility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Brand Share of Voice" icon="bullhorn">
    How does the player's brand compare against competing brands in total fan attention? Understand your share of the market at a glance.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Reports also include pair analysis, historical trends across seasons, market value evolution, and a competitive ranking of the top players by fan engagement.

|--------|-----------------|
| **Fan Reach** | Unique fans who included the player in their team during at least one tournament |
| **Fan Engagement Days** | Total fan-tournament interactions. Equivalent to "active impressions" |
