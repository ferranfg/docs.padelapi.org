Belasteguín, Lebron, Galán, Coello, Tapia, Di Nenno, Lima... everyone has their pick. But **"best" depends on what you measure**.

## By titles and finals

The most common argument: who has won the most. But in padel, the title count comes with twists.

**Padel is a doubles sport.** The top title holders come in pairs. If two players have always played together, they share the exact same numbers. Does that make them both the best, or is it the *pair* that's the best?

**Not all titles are equal.** A Major carries more weight than a P2. As of 2025, Coello and Tapia have accumulated more titles than some players have finals appearances. But how many of those are Majors?

And then there's finals performance. As of 2025, Galán has reached over 40 finals but won less than half. Coello converts 3 out of every 4. The gap is bigger than you'd expect.

<Tip>
  **Ask Padel Analyst:**
  - *"Who has the most titles in men's padel?"*
  - *"How many of Coello's titles are Majors vs P1 vs P2?"*
  - *"What is Galán's win percentage in finals vs semifinals?"*
</Tip>

## By head-to-head and consistency

When two candidates for "best ever" have actually faced each other, the head-to-head record is the most powerful argument. As of 2025, Coello/Tapia and Chingotto/Galán have met in over a dozen finals, and Coello/Tapia hold a clear edge. But it wasn't always that way.

Head-to-head only tells part of the story, though. A player can have a losing record against one specific rival while dominating everyone else. That's where **consistency** completes the picture.

A single great season doesn't make someone the greatest of all time. Sustained dominance does. As of 2025, Coello has maintained a 90%+ win rate across three consecutive seasons, never dipping below 89.9% in any of them. Lebrón, by contrast, has held steady around 74%. Consistent, but at a very different level.

<Tip>
  **Ask Padel Analyst:**
  - *"Show me the head-to-head between Coello and Galán"*
  - *"Compare Coello's stats in 2023 vs 2024 vs 2025"*
  - *"Show me Lebron's win percentage season by season"*
</Tip>

## By partner impact

This is what makes the "best padel player" debate fundamentally different from tennis. Since padel is always played in doubles, every stat is influenced by who you're playing with.

Comparing a player's performance across different partners is the best way to isolate individual quality. As of 2025, Galán has played with Lebrón, Di Nenno, and Chingotto, reaching finals with all of them. Coello, on the other hand, has only ever played with Tapia in the modern era, making it impossible to know how much of their dominance is individual vs the pair's chemistry.

The partner question is the hardest one in the debate, and arguably the most important.

<Tip>
  **Ask Padel Analyst:**
  - *"What are Galán's stats with Lebron vs with Chingotto?"*
  - *"Has Coello ever played with someone other than Tapia?"*
  - *"Show me pair stats for Lebron with each of his partners"*
</Tip>

## Keep exploring

You're not limited to the questions in this guide. Here are a few more to get started:

- *"Who has the highest win percentage among the top 10 men's players?"*
- *"Who are the top women's players by titles?"*
- *"Simulate a match between Coello/Tapia and Lebron/Galán"*

The data is there. The question is how you choose to read it.
