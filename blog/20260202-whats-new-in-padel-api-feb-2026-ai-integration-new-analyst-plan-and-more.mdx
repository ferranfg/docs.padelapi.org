**Hello developers,**

Since our last update in October, we've been focused on making padel data accessible to everyone, not just developers. Here's what's new:

## 1. Padel API into ChatGPT

The biggest addition since October is **Padel Analyst**, our MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets you query padel data using natural language.

Connect your favorite AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, VS Code, etc,) and ask questions like:

- "Who won the last Premier Padel Major?"
- "Compare Lebron/Galan vs Coello/Tapia head-to-head"
- "Show me the top 10 ranked women players"
- "Simulate a match between two pairs"

No code required. Just ask what you want to know and the AI will fetch the data for you.

## 2. New Analyst Plan (19€/month)

We've introduced a new entry-level plan designed for data analysts, journalists, and padel enthusiasts who want AI-powered access without full API integration:

- Up to 50K requests/month
- MCP access for ChatGPT & Claude
- Natural language data exploration
- API access (last 6 months of data)
- Basic support

Perfect for content creators and analysts who want to explore padel data conversationally.

## 3. 2026 Season Ready

We've expanded our data coverage to include **FIP Gold tournaments**, adding more matches, more players, and deeper insights into the professional and semi-professional padel circuit.

The API is also fully prepared for the **2026 Premier Padel season**. All tournament calendars, player rankings, and match data are being tracked from day one.

Also new since October:

- **Pairs endpoint**: Full pair information with match history and statistics
- **Player statistics**: Detailed performance metrics per player
- **Per-page parameter**: Better control over pagination in list endpoints
- **Cancelled match status**: Track match cancellations
- **Timezone fixes**: Improved live match point-by-point data accuracy
- **Padel Fan Index**: Fan engagement analytics for Business plan subscribers
