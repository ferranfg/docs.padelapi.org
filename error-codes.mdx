title: "Error Codes"
description: "Complete reference for Padel API HTTP status codes and error responses. Learn how to handle 401, 402, 404, 422, 429, and 500 errors in your application."
---

The Padel API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

| Code Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `2xx` | Success — The request was successful |
| `3xx` | Redirection — The resource has moved |
| `4xx` | Client Error — Something is wrong with the request |
| `5xx` | Server Error — Something went wrong on our end |

---

## Success Codes

### 200 - OK

The request was successful and the response contains the requested data.

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "total": 42
  }
}
```

---

## Redirection Codes

### 302 - Found (Redirect)

The requested resource has been moved to a new location. This typically happens when a player or tournament record has been updated or merged with new data.

**How to handle:**
- Follow the redirect URL provided in the `Location` header
- Update any cached references to use the new URL
- Most HTTP clients handle redirects automatically

```bash
# Example: Player data was merged
curl -i 'https://padelapi.org/api/players/123'

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://padelapi.org/api/players/456
```

## Client Error Codes

### 401 - Unauthenticated

Authentication failed. Your API token is missing, invalid, or has been revoked.

**How to fix:**
1. Verify you're including the `Authorization` header in your request
2. Check that your token format is correct: `Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN`
3. Generate a new token at [API Tokens](https://padelapi.org/user/api-tokens) if needed

```bash
# Correct format
curl -X GET 'https://padelapi.org/api/seasons' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

```json
{
  "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

<Warning>
  Never share your API token publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

### 402 - Payment Required

Your current subscription plan does not include access to this resource or you have exceeded your plan limits.

**How to fix:**
1. Check your current plan at [padelapi.org/billing](https://padelapi.org/billing)
2. Upgrade your subscription to access premium endpoints
3. Review the [pricing plans](https://padelapi.org/#pricing) for available features

```json
{
  "message": "Subscription required.",
  "contact_email": "ferran@padelapi.org",
  "error_time": "2026-01-19 15:42:31"
}
```

### 404 - Not Found

The requested resource does not exist. This can happen when:
- The ID doesn't exist in the database
- The resource was deleted
- There's a typo in the endpoint URL

**How to fix:**
1. Verify the resource ID is correct
2. Check the endpoint URL for typos
3. Use a list endpoint to find valid IDs

```json
{
  "message": "Not found.",
  "contact_email": "ferran@padelapi.org",
  "error_time": "2026-01-19 15:42:31"
}
```

### 422 - Unprocessable Entity

The request parameters failed validation. The response includes details about which parameters are invalid.

**How to fix:**
1. Review the error message for specific validation failures
2. Check parameter types (string vs integer)
3. Verify required parameters are included
4. Ensure values are within allowed ranges

```json
{
  "message": "The selected category is invalid.",
  "errors": {
    "category": [
      "The selected category is invalid."
    ]
  }
}
```

### 429 - Too Many Requests

You have exceeded the API rate limit.

```json
{
  "message": "Too Many Attempts."
}
```

**How to handle:**
1. Wait until the next minute before retrying
2. Monitor the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header to avoid hitting the limit
3. Implement request throttling in your application

See [Rate Limits](/#rate-limits) for details on limits and available headers.

## Server Error Codes

### 500 - Internal Server Error

Something went wrong on our servers. We automatically log all errors and work to fix them as quickly as possible.

**How to handle:**
1. Wait a few moments and retry your request
2. If the error persists, contact us with the **error_time** included in the response

```json
{
  "message": "Server Error",
  "contact_email": "ferran@padelapi.org",
  "error_time": "2026-01-19 15:42:31"
}
```

<Note>
  When reporting a 500 error, please include the `error_time` from the response. This helps us locate and fix the issue faster.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Always check the status code** before processing the response body
2. **Handle redirects** — Configure your HTTP client to follow 302 redirects
3. **Implement retry logic** for 500 errors with exponential backoff
4. **Log error responses** to help debug integration issues
5. **Include `error_time`** when reporting server errors to support
